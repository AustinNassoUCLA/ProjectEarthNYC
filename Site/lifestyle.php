<h1 style="color: white"> Project Earth Fat Loss Program! </h1>
<p class="body_text"> My name is Casey Eichner. I am currently the CEO of Project Earth Incorporated. In February of 2010 I weighed about 235 LBS at 5’11’’ with an unhealthy proportion of muscle to fat. This was partially due to the fact that I played offensive lineman in high school and had been sitting on a couch for a few months due to a broken ankle injury. Over the next 6 months after my recovery I employed a nutrition and workout routine that was simple yet effective if one can follow through. In the end I lost about 65 LBS. One mistake that most people make when starting out a new routine or diet is that they only go for one or two weeks then quit because the pain of the new process is too great for them and the light at the end of the tunnel seems non existent. Now if one can follow through with the program for at least 21 days then after those 21 days the new routine will turn into a habit and will no longer feel as painful as it did in the time building up to this moment. All I ask is that you give this diet a try for at least 21 days. Its very simple and the results will be immense. You will be amazed at what you are capable of accomplishing if you just put your mind to it. Good Luck!</p>

<li>Eat one large salad around 12pm-2pm that contains a dressing with very little fat such as a vinegar without oil if possible. Also the salad can contain some protein but try and avoid red meat.</li><br />
<li>Eat one large salad around 5pm-6pm that contains a dressing with very little fat such as a vinegar without oil if possible. Also the salad can contain some protein but try and avoid red meat.</li><br/>
<li>Drink water constantly throughout the day. This will help to quell hunger. </li><br/>
<li>Try and stay away from juice and sodas as these contain high doses of sugar. Hint: I would drink coffee in the morning to help put a liquid in my stomach. </li><br/>
<li>If the hunger is too much between waking up and your first meal. I would recommend drinking a protein shake in the morning to help put fuel in your body.</li><br/>

<ul class="body_text">
<li>At the minimum try and run 2 miles on the treadmill or outdoors if you can. Try and complete the 2 miles within a 30 minute time period if possible. </li><br />
<li>As this becomes easier and if time permits, run another 2 miles at another point in the day with the same parameters.</li>
<br />
<li> Weight training is recommended if possible or in substitution of the other 2 mile run </li>
<br />
<li> Recommended exercises: 4x10 reps of pull-ups, 4x10 reps of chin-ups</li>
<br />
<li> Pull ups and Chin ups are full upper body workouts that attack every muscle. If time is limited or funds are limited then the best option is to get a door gym which are usually very cheap to purchase. </li>
<br />
<li> The sets should increase over time as you get thinner and your upper body starts to get stronger. </li>
</ul>
