PROJECT: Project Earth, L.L.C. Website

LANGUAGES EMPLOYED: HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, PHP, MySQL

DESCRIPTION: This project was my first experience using PHP and MySQL together. The major function of this website was to create an online store. I created a basic online store functionality with a front-end shopping card and database driven purchase feature connected to paypal. My favorite part about this project is how smooth the front-end shopping cart is. There is a small button located on the side of the screen and when pressed, a shopping cart appears that dynamically calculates the total cost of the products.  

Features:
* This website has 5 navigational pages
* Custom slideshow inspired by the iPhone sliding screens
* PHP Submission used to send "contact" e-mail
* Fully fledged online store
* Custom front-end shopping cart
